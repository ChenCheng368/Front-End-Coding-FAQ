1. Q: <button> or <div>?
   A: Divitis Problem : https://csscreator.com/divitis
   In general you want to use <a> for navigation and <button> for some action that takes place on that screen.
   a <button> tag does not remove selection, but div does.
   
   
2. Q:css outline vs border
   A:
   1)The outline property doesn't take up space because it always is placed on top of the box of the element.
   When an outline is placed around an element, it doesn't have any effect on how that element is laid out on the page. 
   It doesn't change the element's size or position.This is not true of a border.
   2)The outline-color property accepts the term "invert" which makes the outline color the inverse of the current background. 
   This allows you to highlight elements on dynamic Web pages without needing to know what colors are used.
   3)border has properties to style each side with border-top:, border-left: etc. 
   outline can't do this. There's no outline-top: etc. It's all or nothing.
